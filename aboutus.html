				Daily Reading Worksheets will take about 30 minutes to complete – in two sessions a week and another five assignments completed at home. Your child will work at his or her own pace, mastering each new reading concept before moving on. With each worksheet, your child’s overall reading and writing skills will advance incrementally.

				<h3>Helping Your Child Learn to Read</h3>
				<p>	 
There is probably no more important activity for preparing your child to succeed as a reader than reading aloud together. Fill your story times with a variety of books. Be consistent, be patient, and watch the magic work. Even after children learn to read by themselves, it’s still important for you to read aloud together. By reading stories that are on their interest level, but beyond their reading level, you can stretch young readers’ understanding and motivate them to improve their skills. We aim to engage young minds and make learning more engaging — but we also appreciate that the end result should be better academic results. That's why we're proud to help our students achieve up to three times.  We also align our tutoring programs with college and career readiness standards, so you can expect your child to develop the kind of skills required for success after high school and, eventually, in the modern workforce.
